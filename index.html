                <p class="objective">I am very interested in the world of programming. 
                    Creating something intangible that helps solve material problems is magic. I'm not a magician yet, I'm just learning. For a while I studied on my own, gained some basic knowledge. I think it's time to learn from the community, to become part of the community. The case led me to your courses, I spent a month of preparation, and now I gained a firm conviction that I wanted to learn from you, I wanted to absorb the knowledge and experience that you share.</p>
